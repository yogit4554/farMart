# Problem Statement: Efficient Log Retrieval from a Large File

## Background  

You are tasked with developing a solution to efficiently extract logs from a large log file. The file is approximately **1 TB** in size and contains logs generated over multiple years. Each log entry starts with a timestamp, followed by the log level, and then the log message. Logs are generated almost equally every day.

**Log Format Example:**  

```txt
2024-12-01 14:23:45 INFO User logged in  
2024-12-01 14:24:10 ERROR Failed to connect to the database  
2024-12-02 09:15:30 WARN Disk space running low  
```

To download the log file, run the following command in your terminal:
```curl
curl -L -o test_logs.log "https://limewire.com/d/90794bb3-6831-4e02-8a59-ffc7f3b8b2a3#X1xnzrH5s4H_DKEkT_dfBuUT1mFKZuj4cFWNoMJGX98"
```

## Objective  

Write a script that takes a specific date as an argument (in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`) and efficiently returns all log entries for that date.

---

## Constraints  

- The solution must handle a file size of around **1 TB**.
- Logs are nearly evenly distributed across days.  
- Efficiency in time and resource utilization is critical.  

---

## Expectations  

1. **Input:** A date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) passed as a command-line argument.  
2. **Output:** All log entries for the specified date, saved to a file named `output/output_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`.  
3. **Performance:** The solution should optimize for speed and memory usage.  

---

## Evaluation Criteria  

- **Total Running Time:** Time taken to return the result for the first query.  
- **Code Quality:** Readability, modularity, and proper error handling.  

---

## Example Usage  

**Python**  

```bash
python extract_logs.py 2024-12-01
```

**C**  

```bash
./extract_logs 2024-12-01
```

**C++**  

```bash
./extract_logs 2024-12-01
```

**Java**  

```bash
java ExtractLogs 2024-12-01
```

**Node.js**  

```bash
node extract_logs.js 2024-12-01
```

**Expected Output:**  

```txt
2024-12-01 14:23:45 INFO User logged in  
2024-12-01 14:24:10 ERROR Failed to connect to the database  
```
